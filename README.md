# 🔐 Cyber17 – Fake Link & Phishing Detector

Cyber17 is a beginner-friendly cybersecurity web tool built with **Python + Flask**.  
It helps users analyze URLs and detect **potential phishing, impersonation, and unsafe links**.

Built and tested on **Android (Termux)** but works on Linux & Windows too.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The user enters a URL into the web interface
2. Cyber17 analyzes the link using rule-based checks such as:
   - Suspicious keywords commonly used in phishing attacks
   - Unsafe or unusual top-level domains (TLDs)
   - Use of HTTP vs HTTPS
   - URL structure and length patterns
3. Based on these checks, the system assigns a risk level:
   - Low
   - Medium
   - High
4. Scan results are displayed to the user and saved locally as a report
